    <p>
        Welcome to Omufisi Bites, where the flavors are wild, the portions
        are generous, <br> and the chef might just wink at you while
        tossing the salad. <br> 
        <br> 

        <b>Warning: </b>our food has been known to cause
        spontaneous happy dances.

    <h2>Main Courses</h2>
    <p>
        Our main courses are the heroes of your stomach.
        Juicy grilled salmon, creamy chicken alfredo, <br>and our veggie burger that
        even meat-lovers secretly love—each plate comes with a side of “wow,<br>
        that’s amazing” and zero judgment if you lick it clean.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Grilled Salmon</strong> - Fresh salmon grilled to perfection with lemon butter sauce.
        </li>

    </ul>

   
    <h2>Desserts</h2>
    <p>
        Desserts at Omufisi Bites are basically tiny celebrations in a dish.<br>
        Chocolate lava cake that oozes happiness, cheesecake that could win<br>
        awards for hugs-per-bite, and fruit tarts that scream “eat me before<br>
        I run away!”—you’ll leave with a smile and maybe a sugar high.
