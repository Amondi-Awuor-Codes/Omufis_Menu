Welcome to Omufisi Bites, a fun little HTML project where I created a fictional restaurant menu webpage.
The goal? To practice HTML structure, headings, lists, links, and paragraph.
This project is a menu come to life: appetizers that bite back, main courses that make you drool, and desserts that steal the show.
You’ll find descriptions, a simple page layout, and a link placeholder for a contact page.
It’s perfect for learning HTML basics in a fun, interactive way, and it’s a tasty addition to my portfolio.
